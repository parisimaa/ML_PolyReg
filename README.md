# ML_Polynomial_Reg
This is a problem of fitting a Polynomial function for finding a one-dimentional function. 
d is the degree of the polynomial.
We need to find a theta that minimize the risk:

Use Problem1.mat file as the dataset which consists of input variable X and output Y. 
Split the dataset randomly into training and test sets (you need to adjust some parameters for other datasets)
Cross-validation has been used for finding the optimum order of the polynomial function.
